# Airbnb Data Analysis Project
This project aims to predict popularity of Airbnb listing.

A regression problem of predicting reviews_per_month, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing with [New York City Airbnb listings from 2019 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.
